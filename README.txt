JJFrame by James Jay

It will help you to build:
Responsive website with: 
  * fixed header
  * vertical or horizontal menu
  * custom links with images

Usage:

1. Open index.html(vertical menu) or index.1.html(horizontal menu) on demo folder to view simple demos
2. Copy jjframe.css into your projects css folder eg. css
3. Copy the 'images' folder into main project folder
4. Link your main html file (index.html) to the jjframe.css folder (in our case 'css') 

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/jjframe.css"> 

Use special classes provided:
1. for vertical menu:
  * on main navigation menu div (or <nav> as in our examples) use class 'menu-vertical'
  * on main div with content (or <content> as in our examples) use classes 'content' and 'below-vertical-menu'
2. for horizontal menu (on mobile it will become vertical):
  * on main navigation menu div (or <nav> as in our examples) use class 'menu-horizontal'
  * on main div with content (or <content> as in our examples) use classes 'content' and 'below-horizontal-menu'
3. for centered text use class 'text-center' like our brand name on our header or links
